## Chapter 4

### Day 1

**1. Explain what lives inside of an account.**

**2. What is the difference between the /storage/, /public/, and /private/ paths?**

**3. What does .save() do? What does .load() do? What does .borrow() do?**

**4. Explain why we couldn't save something to our account storage inside of a script.**

**5. Explain why I couldn't save something to your account.**

**6. Define a contract that returns a resource that has at least 1 field in it. Then, write 2 transactions:**

  **- A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then loads it out of account storage, logs a field inside the resource, and destroys it.**

  **- A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then borrows a reference to it, and logs a field inside the resource.**

### Day 2

**1. What does .link() do?**

**2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path.**

**3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:**

  **- In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.**

  **- Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.**

  **- Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.**

### Day 3

**1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.**

**2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")**

**3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.**

  **- Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.**

  **- Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?**

### Day 4

**Take our NFT contract so far and add comments to every single resource or function explaining what it's doing in your own words. Something like this:**
```
pub contract CryptoPoops {
  pub var totalSupply: UInt64

  // This is an NFT resource that contains a name,
  // favouriteFood, and luckyNumber
  pub resource NFT {
    pub let id: UInt64

    pub let name: String
    pub let favouriteFood: String
    pub let luckyNumber: Int

    init(_name: String, _favouriteFood: String, _luckyNumber: Int) {
      self.id = self.uuid

      self.name = _name
      self.favouriteFood = _favouriteFood
      self.luckyNumber = _luckyNumber
    }
  }

  // This is a resource interface that allows us to... you get the point.
  pub resource interface CollectionPublic {
    pub fun deposit(token: @NFT)
    pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64]
    pub fun borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &NFT
  }

  pub resource Collection: CollectionPublic {
    pub var ownedNFTs: @{UInt64: NFT}

    pub fun deposit(token: @NFT) {
      self.ownedNFTs[token.id] <-! token
    }

    pub fun withdraw(withdrawID: UInt64): @NFT {
      let nft <- self.ownedNFTs.remove(key: withdrawID) 
              ?? panic("This NFT does not exist in this Collection.")
      return <- nft
    }

    pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64] {
      return self.ownedNFTs.keys
    }

    pub fun borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &NFT {
      return (&self.ownedNFTs[id] as &NFT?)!
    }

    init() {
      self.ownedNFTs <- {}
    }

    destroy() {
      destroy self.ownedNFTs
    }
  }

  pub fun createEmptyCollection(): @Collection {
    return <- create Collection()
  }

  pub resource Minter {

    pub fun createNFT(name: String, favouriteFood: String, luckyNumber: Int): @NFT {
      return <- create NFT(_name: name, _favouriteFood: favouriteFood, _luckyNumber: luckyNumber)
    }

    pub fun createMinter(): @Minter {
      return <- create Minter()
    }

  }

  init() {
    self.totalSupply = 0
    self.account.save(<- create Minter(), to: /storage/Minter)
  }
}
```
