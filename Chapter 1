## Chapter 1

### Day 1

**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp******

A public database that is not owned by anyone and that anyone can store stuff inside of it.

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts**

A program that one can deploy onto the Blockchain and people can interact with.

**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

Scripts do not cost money. Scripts can only view data on the blockchain.

Transactions cost money. Transactions can view or change data on the blockchain.

### Day 2

**1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming

**2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

Safety and Security: Protects me from malicious Cadence programmers.

Clarity: We can verify that a person's smart contract is safe because we can read it easily.

Approachability: If I know other languages, Cadence might be easier for me to learn.

Developer Experience: I can see why my contract is failing and fix it easily.
